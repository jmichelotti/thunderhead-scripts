# Thunderhead Jellyfin Scripts

Personal Python utilities for managing and maintaining my
**ThunderheadFlix** Jellyfin media server.

These scripts help with:

-   Renaming TV shows and movies
-   Fixing metadata for Jellyfin
-   Extracting and adjusting subtitles
-   Migrating and reorganizing media files
-   Downloading content for local Jellyfin use
-   Analyzing disk usage

This repo is primarily designed for my local media structure and
workflows.
